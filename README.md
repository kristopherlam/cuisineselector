Step 1: Create a list of cuisines

Step 2: Display the list of cuisines as text elements on luckydraw wheel.

Step 3: Add a button that, when clicked, randomly selects one of the cuisines from your list. You can do this by setting up a button in your graphics window.

Step 4: After a cuisine is selected, display it prominently in the window, perhaps changing its color or size to make it stand out. You might also want to clear any previous selections to avoid confusion.
